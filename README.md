OpenStereo is an open source, cross-platform software for structural geology analysis.

The software is written in Python, a high-level, cross-platform programming language and 
the GUI is designed with wxPython, which provide a consistent look regardless the OS. 
Numeric operations (like matrix and linear algebra) are performed with the Numpy module and 
all graphic capabilities are provided by the Matplolib library, including on-screen plotting and 
graphic exporting to common desktop formats (emf, eps, ps, pdf, png, svg).

OpenStereo is released under the GNU General Public License v.3.

This fork aims to add some localization features to OpenStereo.
