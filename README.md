OpenStereoNet is an open source, cross-platform software for structural geology analysis.
OpenStereoNet is a fork of OpenStereo. This fork aims to add some localization features to OpenStereo but, not only.

The software is written in Python, a high-level, cross-platform programming language and 
the GUI is designed with wxPython, which provide a consistent look regardless the OS. 
Numeric operations (like matrix and linear algebra) are performed with the Numpy module and 
all graphic capabilities are provided by the Matplolib library, including on-screen plotting and 
graphic exporting to common desktop formats (emf, eps, ps, pdf, png, svg).

OpenStereoNet is released under the GNU General Public License v.3.
